# Task Manager

## Overview
A full-stack task manager application with a REST API backend and modern frontend UI.

## Requirements
- Node.js installed on your machine.
- SQLite or JSON file for persistent storage (JSON is used in this example).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/task-manager.git
   cd task-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
- Add new tasks by entering a title in the input field and clicking "Add Task".
- Mark tasks as complete or incomplete using checkboxes.
- Filter tasks by all, active (not completed), or completed.

## Notes
- This is a basic implementation for demonstration purposes. You may want to add more features like user authentication, error handling, and better UI/UX improvements.
